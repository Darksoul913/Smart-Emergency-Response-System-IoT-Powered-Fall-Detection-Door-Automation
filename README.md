Smart Emergency Response System: AI-Powered Fall Detection & Door Automation 🚑🔐

🔹 Project Type: IoT & AI-based Safety System
🔹 Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi 4, Python, OpenCV, Sensor Integration
🔹 Domain: Healthcare & Smart Home Automation

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing safety for elderly and mobility-impaired individuals by implementing a real-time fall detection system with automated door unlocking for emergency access. The system leverages AI, IoT, and motion detection to instantly recognize falls and trigger alerts to caregivers or emergency responders.

🚀 Key Features

✅ AI-Based Fall Detection: Uses camera-based motion analysis and sensor data to detect sudden falls.
✅ Automated Emergency Response: Triggers real-time alerts and sends notifications when a fall is detected.
✅ Smart Door Unlocking: Automatically unlocks the door upon fall detection, ensuring quick emergency access.
✅ IoT-Driven Integration: Raspberry Pi 4 is used for real-time processing and system control.
✅ Customizable Alerts: Notifies caregivers via mobile alerts or emails.

🛠 Technology Stack
	•	Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, Camera Module, Door Locking Mechanism
	•	Software: Python, OpenCV, Flask (for API & alerts), MQTT (for IoT communication)
	•	AI & Image Processing: Motion Analysis, Threshold-Based Fall Detection
